# Imputation Techniques for Missing Values in Educational Data

The imputation of missing values in the detail data of Educational Institutions is a difficult task. These data contain multivariate time series, which cannot be satisfactory imputed by many existing imputation techniques. Moreover, almost all the data of an Institution are interconnected: the number of graduates is not independent from the number of students, the expenditure is not independent from the staff, etc. Therefore, imputation techniques for this specific case should be carefully designed. We provide here codes for an imputation methodology described in : R. Bruni, C. Daraio and D. Aureli, Imputation techniques for the reconstruction of missing interconnected data from higher Educational Institutions, Knowledge-Based Systems (2020) 106512, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106512.

# ETER Imputation Techniques

Optimization Methods for the Imputation of Missing Values in Educational Institutions Data.

â€¢	The imputation of missing values in the detail data of Educational Institutions is a difficult task. These data contain multivariate time series, which cannot be satisfactory imputed by many existing imputation techniques. Moreover, almost all the data of an Institution are interconnected: the number of graduates is not independent from the number of students, the expenditure is not independent from the staff, etc. In other words, each imputed value may impact on the situation of the whole institution. Therefore, imputation techniques for this specific case should be carefully designed. We provide here methods and codes for an imputation methodology that we have proposed to deal with the different types of missing values appearing in these interconnected data. In particular, a first part of the proposed methodology, called "trend smoothing imputation", is designed to impute missing values in time series by respecting the trend and the other features of an Institution. The second part of the proposed methodology, called "donor imputation", is designed to impute larger chunks of missing data by using values taken form similar Institutions in order to respect again their size and trend.
